In this summary of descriptive statistical analysis, the first discussion is about measures of central tendency which contain mean, mode, and median. Mean is the method usually used to find the average for our dataset values. We have to add up all dataset values and divide them by the total number of dataset values. From the video games datasets, NA_Sales which is also called video games sales of North America having a 5.05 mean value. This shows that the average sales of North America are 5.05. Same analysis concept for EU_Sales (Video Games Sales of European Union) having 3.63 mean value, JP_Sales (Video Games Sales of Japan) having a 1.20 mean value, and Other_Sales (Video Games Sales of other regions) having a 1.18 mean value. Hence, the highest average of video game sales is sales of North America and the lowest average of video game sales is sales of other regions.

Besides, the mode is the common way to simply get the most frequent dataset value. The mode of NA_Sales is 3.27 which means that the video games sales 3.27 is the most frequent value of sales in North America. Same analysis concept for EU_Sales that having 4.24 mode value, JP_Sales that having 0.00 and 0.07 mode values, Other_Sales that having 0.50 and 1.03 mode value. Besides, the following analysis is median. Median is the value in the middle of datasets. The median of NA_Sales is 3.57 that means 3.57 is occupied at the center in the data values of NA_Sales. The same analysis concept goes to EU_Sales which having a 2.53 median value, JP_Sales which having a 0.38 median value, and Other_Sales which having a 0.87 median value.
Next, standard deviation (σ) is a value that demonstrates how much dispersion and variance occurs from the mean or expected value. The standard deviation of NA_Sales is 4.93 which is called low standard deviation that the data points tend to close with its mean of 5.05. Same analysis concept for EU_Sales that having 3.50 standard deviation value which also a low standard deviation,  JP_Sales that having 1.53  standard deviation value which also a low standard deviation and Other_Sales that having 1.41 standard deviation value which also a low standard deviation. 

The maximum video game sales in North America is 41.36 for a video game named Wii Sports and the minimum video game sales in North America is 0.08 for a video game named World of Warcraft. Besides, the maximum video game sales in European Union is 28.96 for a video game named Wii Sports too and the minimum video game sales in European Union is 0.00 for a video game named Final Fantasy XII.

Chart 1.1
*All Sales Are in Million Dollars Unit
The stacked bar graph is a graph that can show the total group’s size. It is keen on showing how the extents between groups identified with one another and also each group’s total. The stacked bar graph shows sub-groups that are stacked on the same bar. Different sub-groups were represented by different colors. 
Chart1.1 showed a ‘Global Sales for Every Genre of Video Games’ stacked bar graph.  According to Chart 1.1, blue color represent the video game sales of North America, orange color represent the video game sales of the European Union, green color represents the video game sales of Japan, and red color represent the video game sales of other countries. We can see that the highest sales in global are the video games in the genre of action which had over 200 sales of video games global. Hence, we can conclude that most people like to buy video games in the genre of action such as Metal Gear Solid, Red Dead Redemption, and Driver. In the sales for action genre video games, the bar showed that the sales in North America had occupied the most of the sales which are almost 100 sales of video games. Followed by the second and the third highest sales in the global are shooter and sports genre of video games such as Battlefield 3 and FIFA 14. This shows that the shooter and sports genre of video games are also popular. Besides that, the video games sales for Racing, Misc, Platform, and Role-Playing are in the range between 50 to 150 sales globally. Therefore, this genre of video games is classified as moderately popular globally.  Simulation, fighting, puzzle, and adventure type of video games are less popular due to their sales being below 50 sales. Therefore, we can conclude that these genres of video games are lacking interest to the people globally. The least sales of video games are adventure type of video games and we can conclude that the adventure genre of video games is the most unpopular of video games. 
In the North American region, people like to buy the shooter genre of video games the most and dislike to buy the adventure genre of video games the most. Besides that, sports, shooter, and action genres of video games are the most popular video games to buy and the adventure genre of video games is the most unpopular video game to buy in the European Union region.

Chart 1.2

A Scatter plot is a set of data plotted on horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) axes. It can show the extent of correlation between variables. According to Chart 1.2, there is a scatter plot showing the relationship between critic score and user score for the video games platform. In Chart 1.2, there are many different colors represented on the different video game platforms. We can see that the behavior of the scatter plot is a partial type of correlation that contains a slightly positive pattern. When the critic scores increase, user scores also increase.  The degree of the correlation for this scatter plot is low as all the points are not so concentrated. 
According to Chart 1.2, The PS platform gained the highest user score which had over 9 marks, and also gained a high score in critic score that over 90 marks for the video games. Hence, we can know that the PS platform is a famous video game platform. However, the PS3 platform is the platform that gained the least score that is not over 3 marks, and also gained a moderate critic score which is around 70 marks. Therefore, we know the PS3 is an unpopular video game platform. X360 platform is the highest score platform which is near to 100 marks and its user score is also high which is near to 8 marks. Hence, we can know that X360 is also a good video game platform. Moreover, the Wii platform gained the least critic score which is less than 50 marks but having 8 marks in user score for video games can be considered as a pretty good score in user score. Therefore, the Wii video games platform might not be suitable for the critic but the user.
